# Print_Point
Print Point offers a reference marking system for 3DP processes that solves this problem by detecting and matching these markers with the digital elements on the 3D model. Our system uses advanced algorithms, ensuring precise and accurate printing every time.

The workflow is easy and straightforward: first generating a catalogue of the digital references, sorting them with arUco markers, recording their position will give the identity, location and orientation of the element through computer vision, and finally import this data to update the digital printing model.
